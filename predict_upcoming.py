"""Predict upcoming EPL fixtures and save the predictions.

Usage:
    python predict_upcoming.py            # on your computer
    python predict_upcoming.py --record   # the automated weekly run: also updates the official record

Fits the model on finished matches before today and predicts every scheduled match
that hasn't kicked off yet. A match's prediction can be refreshed until kickoff and
is never changed after it, so stored predictions form a genuine pre-match track record.

The official record is records/live_predictions.csv, written by the automated weekly
run (--record). Without --record, recorded predictions are loaded into your local
database and left as they are; only matches missing from the record are predicted
locally, and the record file itself isn't changed.
