"""Run the walk-forward backtest and save its predictions to the database.

Usage:
    python run_backtest.py

For every week since 2016/17, the model is trained only on matches played before
that week and predicts that week's games. The predictions are saved under their
own model name, separate from the live predictions made by predict_upcoming.py.
The website's backtest and results pages read them. Re-run after importing new
results so the backtest covers the latest matches (it takes a few seconds).
